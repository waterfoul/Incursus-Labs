= IntraACL extension for MediaWiki =

IntraACL extension for MediaWiki is the page rights extension loosely
based on HaloACL, correcting its endless bugs and inconveniences.

* Homepage and help: http://wiki.4intra.net/IntraACL
* License: GNU GPLv3
* Copyright (c) 2010+, Vitaliy Filippov, Stas Fomin
* Loosely based on HaloACL (c) 2009, ontoprise GmbH

== REQUIREMENTS ==

The only requirement is MediaWiki of at least version 1.13.2.

== INSTALLATION ==

* Add the following lines into your LocalSettings.php:
  require_once('extensions/IntraACL/includes/HACL_Initialize.php');
  enableIntraACL();
* You can also add custom configuration options before enableIntraACL() call. For the option list, see extensions/IntraACL/includes/HACL_Initialize.php or http://wiki.4intra.net/IntraACL
* Apply patches for appropriate version of MediaWiki:
  cd YOUR_WIKI_INSTALLATION_DIR
  patch -p1 < patches/IntraACL-MediaWiki-<YOUR_VERSION>.diff
* Run MediaWiki database update tool:
  php maintenance/update.php

The method of IntraACL installation via the super-duper-installer
of Halo MediaWiki bundle is now removed as very non-standard.

The protection of semantic properties via encrypting them is also removed.
IntraACL is thus incompatible with SemanticMediaWiki.

== WARNING ==

ANY installed extension MAY lead to SECURITY BREACHES.

This is because of MediaWiki by-design openness and extensibility
and the need for direct database queries from extension code.

You should check that all your extensions perform access right checks
using <tt>$title->userCanRead()</tt> before displaying $title content.

== MediaWiki 4 Intranet ==

You can also use Mediawiki4Intranet bundle. It already includes IntraACL and
many other useful extensions which are patched to perform access right checks.
